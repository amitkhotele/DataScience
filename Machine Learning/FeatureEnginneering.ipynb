    "# Assignment Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a parameter?**\n",
    "    - A parameter is a variable in a model that is learned from data during training, such as weights in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is correlation?**\n",
    "    - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, indicating how one variable changes with respect to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does negative correlation mean?**\n",
    "    - Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?**\n",
    "    - Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. Main components include Data, Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?**\n",
    "    - The loss value quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values. Lower loss values indicate better model performance; high loss means poor predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n",
    "    - Continuous variables can take any numerical value within a range (e.g., height, weight). Categorical variables represent discrete categories or groups (e.g., gender, color).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?**\n",
    "    - Categorical variables are converted to numerical format using techniques like Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?**\n",
    "    - The training dataset is used to fit the model, while the testing dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is sklearn.preprocessing?**\n",
    "    - `sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in scikit-learn for data preprocessing, including scaling, encoding, and transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is a Test set?**\n",
    "    - A test set is a subset of data used to assess the performance of a trained model and estimate its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n",
    "    - Data can be split using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`, which divides data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?**\n",
    "    - Steps: Understand the problem, collect data, preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineer features, select a model, train the model, evaluate performance, and deploy the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?**\n",
    "    - EDA helps understand data distribution, detect anomalies, identify patterns, and guide preprocessing and feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What is correlation?**\n",
    "    - Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What does negative correlation mean?**\n",
    "    - Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **How can you find correlation between variables in Python?**\n",
    "    - You can use the `df.corr()` method in pandas to compute correlation between variables in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.**\n",
    "    - Causation means one variable directly affects another. Correlation is just association. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning rates are correlated (both increase in summer), but eating ice cream does not cause drowning.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.**\n",
    "    - An optimizer updates model parameters to minimize the loss function. Types:\n",
    "        - **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent):** Updates weights using the gradient of the loss for each sample.\n",
    "        - **Adam:** Uses adaptive learning rates and combines momentum and RMSprop techniques.\n",
    "        - **RMSprop:** Maintains per-parameter learning rates, adjusting them based on recent gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **What is sklearn.linear_model ?**\n",
    "    - `sklearn.linear_model` is a module in scikit-learn for linear models such as LinearRegression and LogisticRegression.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?**\n",
    "    - `model.fit()` trains the model on the given data. Arguments: features (X) and target (y).\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?**\n",
    "    - `model.predict()` predicts target values for new data. Argument: features (X).\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n",
    "    - Continuous variables can take any value within a range. Categorical variables represent distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?**\n",
    "    - Feature scaling standardizes the range of independent variables, improving model convergence and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **How do we perform scaling in Python?**\n",
    "    - Scaling can be performed using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **What is sklearn.preprocessing?**\n",
    "    - `sklearn.preprocessing` is a scikit-learn module for data preprocessing tasks like scaling and encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n",
    "    - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **Explain data encoding?**\n",
    "    - Data encoding transforms categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility, using techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding."
