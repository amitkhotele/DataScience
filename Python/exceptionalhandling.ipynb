    "    1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\\n--> Interpreted languages execute code line by line, whil compiled languages translate code into machine language before execution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. What is exception handling in Python?\\n--> Exception handling lets you manage errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\\n--> The finally block always runs, letting you clean up resources like files or connections, no matter what.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. What is logging in Python?\\n--> Logging records events or errors during program execution, helping with debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\\n--> The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed, useful for cleanup tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\\n--> 'import' brings in the whole module, while 'from ... import' brings in specific parts of a module.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\\n--> You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying a tuple of exceptions in a single except block.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\\n--> The with statement automatically closes the file after its block is executed, even if errors occur.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\\n--> Multithreading runs multiple threads in one process, while multiprocessing runs multiple processes independently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\\n--> Logging helps track events, errors, and program flow, making debugging and maintenance easier.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    11. What is memory management in Python?\\n--> Memory management is how Python allocates and frees memory for objects during program execution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\\n--> Wrap risky code in try, catch errors with except, use else for code if no error, and finally for cleanup.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    13. Why is memory management important in Python?\\n--> Good memory management prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient use of system resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\\n--> The try block holds code that might fail, and except handles the error if one occurs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\\n--> Python automatically frees memory by deleting objects that are no longer referenced.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\\n--> The else block runs if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\\n--> Common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\\n--> os.fork() creates a child process (Unix only), while multiprocessing works cross-platform and is more flexible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\\n--> Closing a file saves changes and frees system resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\\n--> file.read() reads the whole file, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\\n--> The logging module helps record messages about program execution for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\\n--> The os module lets you interact with the operating system, like creating or deleting files and directories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\\n--> Challenges include avoiding memory leaks and managing objects with circular references.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\\n--> Use the raise statement to trigger an exception intentionally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\\n--> Multithreading can make programs faster by doing multiple tasks at once, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
