    "# Python OOPs Questions with Answers\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "    --OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and methods. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "    A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "    Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features. Encapsulation bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "    Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods with names starting and ending with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, etc. They enable operator overloading and customization of built-in behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "    Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to have different behaviors in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    " 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "    Encapsulation is achieved by using private and protected access modifiers (prefixing attributes with _ or __) and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "    A constructor is a special method (__init__) that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "     Class methods use @classmethod decorator and take cls as the first parameter. Static methods use @staticmethod and do not take self or cls.\n",
    "\n",
    " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "     Python does not support traditional method overloading. However, default arguments or *args/**kwargs can be used to achieve similar behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "     Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "     The @property decorator is used to define getter methods, allowing class attributes to be accessed like attributes but with getter/setter logic.\n",
    "\n",
    " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "     Polymorphism increases flexibility and reusability by allowing the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "\n",
    " 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "     An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and often contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Defined using the abc module.\n",
    "\n",
    " 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "     OOP provides modularity, code reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "     Class variables are shared across all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    " 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "     Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    " 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
    "     __str__ returns a readable string representation of an object, used by print(). __repr__ returns an unambiguous string for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    " 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
    "     super() is used to call methods from a parent or sibling class, often used in method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    " 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
    "     __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "     @staticmethod does not access class or instance data. @classmethod takes cls as the first parameter and can modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "     Subclasses can override methods of the parent class, and the correct method is called based on the object's type at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    " 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "     Method chaining is calling multiple methods sequentially in a single line, usually by returning self from each method.\n",
    "\n",
    " 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
    "     __call__ allows an instance of a class to be called as a function."
